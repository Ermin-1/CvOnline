                        <h2>Achived qualifications:</h2><p>
                        
<strong>Structured and Semantic HTML: </strong>My code utilizes proper HTML markup and semantics to organize and structure the content of my web page in a meaningful way. This ensures that screen readers and other assistive technologies can interpret the content correctly, enhancing accessibility.<p>

    <strong>Clear and Consistent Navigation: </strong>My code employs clear and consistent navigation methods across my website, such as a navigation bar or menu, to assist users in orienting themselves. This consistency ensures that users can easily find their way around my site, improving usability.<p>

        <strong>Informative Content: </strong>Each page of my website provides clear and meaningful information, including page headings, titles, and descriptive texts. This ensures that users understand the purpose of each page and can access relevant content easily.<p>

            <strong>Alternative Text Descriptions: </strong>I provide alternative text descriptions for all non-text content elements, such as images, icons, and graphics. This ensures that users who rely on screen readers or have images disabled can understand the content conveyed by these elements.<p>

                <strong>Text Size and Contrast: </strong>Text on my website has sufficient size and contrast to be readable for all users, including those with visual impairments. This includes using appropriate color contrasts and ensuring text is large enough to be legible.<p>

                    <strong>Accessible Links and Buttons: </strong>My code uses clear and descriptive link texts and button labels to enhance navigation for users. This practice improves the accessibility of my website by providing easily understandable cues for interaction.<p>

                        <strong>Accessibility in Responsive Design: </strong>Your website is designed to be usable and accessible across various devices and screen sizes. This responsiveness ensures that users can access your site comfortably regardless of the device they are using.<p>

                            <strong>Avoidance of Moving or Blinking Content: </strong>I refrain from using moving or blinking elements unless they can be stopped, paused, or adjusted by the user. This prevents potential distractions or discomfort for users with certain sensitivities.<p>

                                <strong>Browser Compatibility: </strong>I tested my website's functionality and accessibility across different browsers to ensure full compatibility. This practice ensures that users can access your site regardless of the browser they use.<p>

                                    <strong>Readability and Comprehension: </strong>My code employs a simple and easily understandable language style and structure to facilitate content comprehension for all users.<p>

                                        <strong>Proper Use of Color: </strong>I avoid relying solely on color to convey information and ensure that information is understandable for users who may not perceive color.<p>

                                            <strong>Accessible Data and Tables: </strong>My use of tables and data is accessible by providing descriptive headers and structured information, making it easier for users with disabilities to understand the content.<p>

                                                <strong>Voidance of Solely Audio Content: </strong>I dont use audio-based content, ensuring accessibility for users with hearing impairments.<p></p>

                                                    <strong>Declaration of Standard Language: </strong>My code declares the language of its content using HTML attributes to facilitate correct text interpretation, improving accessibility for users with various language skills or preferences.<p>
                                                    
                                                        <strong>Robustness and Reliability:</strong> My website is designed to be lightweight and fast-loading, ensuring compatibility across a wide range of browsers and devices. By keeping the design simple and avoiding complex features, I minimize the risk of compatibility issues or usability errors.<p></p>

                                                        <strong>Use of Accessible UI Components:</strong> My website utilizes standard UI components and design patterns that are familiar to most users. By avoiding complex or custom elements, I ensure that the interface is easy to navigate and understand for everyone.<p>

            <h2>Not suitable for this website:</h2>
            <p>

                    <strong>Avoid Sole Reliance on Sound:</strong> Since my website doesn't contain any audio content or videos with spoken instructions, there's no need for alternative text or visual cues. Users can easily understand the content through visual means alone, making sound-based alternatives unnecessary.<p>
                    
                    <strong>Accessible Video and Multimedia:</strong> While I may include some multimedia elements in my portfolio, such as project pitcures. I've prioritized visual clarity and simplicity. Any multimedia content is presented in a way that's easily understandable without the need for additional descriptions or subtitles.<p>
                    
                    <strong>Use of ARIA:</strong> Given the straightforward nature of my website, there's limited need for ARIA attributes to enhance accessibility. Users can easily navigate and understand the content without relying on additional assistive technologies or features.<p>
                    
                    <strong>Accessibility in Dynamic Content:</strong> Since my website doesn't feature dynamic content that updates frequently, there's no need for specialized accessibility considerations in this area. Users can navigate static pages without encountering any unexpected changes or interruptions.<p>
                    
                    <strong>Progressive Enhancement:</strong> While progressive enhancement is a valuable principle in web development, my focus is on simplicity and clarity. By prioritizing clean design and intuitive navigation, I ensure that all users can access and understand the content, regardless of their device or browser capabilities.<p>

                    <strong>Accessible Form Controls:</strong> There are no forms to fill out because my website is strictly for showcasing my cv and portfolio.<p>
                    
                    <strong>Error Handling and Feedback:</strong> I've designed my website to minimize the possibility of user errors by providing clear instructions and intuitive interfaces. In the rare event of an error, users can easily identify and correct it without the need for explicit feedback mechanisms.<p>
                    
                    <strong>Flexible Input and Data Formats:</strong> Since my website primarily presents static content, there's limited need for flexible input formats or data presentation options. Users can consume the content in its standard format, without the need for customization or adaptation.<p>
                    
                    <strong>Accessibility Testing and Validation:</strong> While accessibility is important, the simplicity of my website means that most accessibility considerations are addressed during the design and development process. Formal testing and validation are unnecessary for such a straightforward site.<p>
                    
                    <strong>Accessible Tools and Utilities:</strong> While I recognize the importance of accessible tools and utilities, my website's simplicity means that users can easily navigate and interact with it using standard browsing tools. Specialized accessibility features are therefore unnecessary.<p>
                    
                    <strong>Documentation of Accessibility Features:</strong> Given the straightforward nature of my website, detailed documentation of accessibility features is unnecessary. The design and content are intuitive enough that users with diverse needs can easily understand and navigate the site.<p>
                    
                    <strong>Continued Education and Awareness:</strong> While I strive to stay informed about accessibility best practices, my focus is primarily on showcasing my skills and accomplishments. I prioritize simplicity and clarity in my website design to ensure that all users can easily access and understand the content.<p>
                    
                    <strong>Accessibility Testing with Users:</strong> While user testing is valuable, the simplicity of my website means that accessibility issues are unlikely to arise. I've designed the site with usability in mind, making it easy for all users to navigate and interact with the content.<p>
                    
                    <strong>Accessible Keyboard Interface:</strong> Since my website is primarily a showcase of my CV and portfolio, users don't need complex keyboard navigation. They can easily navigate using standard scrolling and clicking actions, which are familiar and intuitive for most users.<p></p>
                    
                    <strong>Continuous Improvement:</strong> While I'm open to feedback and suggestions for improvement, my website's design and content are intentionally kept simple and focused. Major updates or changes are rare, as the site's purpose is to serve as a static showcase of my work and experience.<p>
                    
                    <strong>Communication and Awareness:</strong> While I aim to be transparent and communicative about my website, my primary focus is on presenting my CV and portfolio in a clear and professional manner. Accessibility considerations are important, but they're not the primary focus of the site's messaging or communication.<p>
                    
                    <strong>Reporting and Accountability:</strong> As the sole creator and owner of my website, I take full responsibility for its accessibility and usability. While I don't provide formal reports on accessibility efforts, I'm committed to ensuring that all users can access and understand the content effectively.<p>
